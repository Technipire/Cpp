In the square class, there are two operations:

	left_click(a_game : game)
	uncover()

They appear to be similar.

What are the differences?

1) who calls the operation?

	left_click() results from a user input.

	uncover() comes from the game.
	uncover() is called only by uncover_all_squares().
	uncover_all_squares() is called only when:
		1) you uncover a mine;
		2) you lose the game;
		3) you win the game.

2) what happens in state 2 (covered with flag)?

	left_click() has no effect.

	uncover() causes a state transition.
