1. This is a sample program that does convolution image filtering on 2D data. Implement Image2D class as a subclass of ImageBase class, and ImageFilterBase class that is an abstract class of ImageConvolutionFilter class to make main() function in main.cpp work as it is.


2. Create a subclass of ImageConvolutionFilter class to implement any one of the convolution filter (sobel/laplacian/mean/gaussian/other).


3. Implement (2) in multi-threading
